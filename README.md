## 1. What is Node.js ? [&uarr; Top](#top)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser to execute JavaScript code. Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side scripting, unifying the development process.:

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js is designed to be non-blocking and event-driven, allowing it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for applications that involve real-time features.

2. **Single Programming Language:**: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. This can lead to a more seamless and consistent development experience.

3. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**:  NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and the largest software registry in the world. It allows developers to easily share and reuse code, making it straightforward to incorporate third-party libraries into their projects.

4. **Scalability**: Due to its non-blocking and asynchronous nature, Node.js is well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent connections, making it scalable for applications with high traffic.

5. **Community and Ecosystem**:Node.js has a large and active community of developers, which contributes to its extensive ecosystem of libraries and modules that can be easily integrated into applications.

## 2. What is an event loop in Node.js ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The event loop is a mechanism in Node.js that allows it to handle multiple concurrent operations. It listens for events and sends them to the appropriate callback function when they occur.

## 3. What is a callback function in Node.js ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function. In Node.js, it is commonly used to handle asynchronous operations such as reading and writing files or making API calls.

## 4. What is package.json in Node.js ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
package.json is a configuration file in Node.js that stores metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It is used by Node.js to install dependencies and run scripts.

## 5. What is the difference between require and import in Node.js? ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
**Nodejs require**: 1. Require is Non-lexical, it stays where they have put the file. 2. It can be called at any time and place in the program. 3.require is a built-in function in Node.js that is used to load modules

**import and export**:1. Import is lexical, it gets sorted to the top of the file. 2. It can’t be called conditionally, it always run in the beginning of the file. 3  import is a new syntax introduced in ES6 that is used to load modules in JavaScript. Import is not supported natively in Node.js

## 6. What is the purpose of the global object in Node.js ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The global object in Node.js provides access to global variables and functions, which can be accessed from any module in the application. However, it is not recommended to use the global object as it can lead to naming conflicts and other issues.

1. **Global Scope**: Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keyword are automatically added to the global object. This means that they are accessible from any part of the application.

2. **Global Properties and Methods**: The global object has properties and methods that are built into the Node.js runtime environment. examples include:

     1.console: Provides methods for writing to the console.                                                                                                                                                        
     2.require(): Used for including modules in Node.js.
   
     3.process: Provides information and control over the Node.js process.
   
     4.setTimeout(), setInterval(): Functions for scheduling code execution after a specified time delay or at regular intervals.
   

4. **Global Variables**: Certain variables are available globally, such as __dirname (the directory name of the current module) and __filename (the file name of the current module).
